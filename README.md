# VibranEat: AI-Powered Personalized Diet Planner

VibranEat is an AI-driven personalized diet planning system designed to recommend 7-day meal plans based on an individual's health conditions, BMI, and allergen information. The system integrates multiple machine learning and deep learning models to analyze user health data and dietary needs, delivering medically informed, safe, and personalized nutrition advice.

## 🧩 Project Features

- **Multi-Model Ensemble Architecture**:
  - Logistic Regression for **Diabetes Classification** (95% Accuracy)
  - XGBoost for **Obesity Classification** (97.74% Accuracy)
  - Random Forest + SVM for **Allergy Prediction** (99.26% Accuracy)
  - Deep Learning model (LSTM + DNN) for **Meal Suitability Prediction**

- **7-Day Personalized Meal Plans**:
  - Custom diet generated using prediction results
  - Plans are filtered for:
    - Diabetes-safe food (based on sugar/carb levels)
    - BMI-specific calorie ranges (Underweight to Obesity Type III)
    - Allergen-free meals (Gluten, Peanut, or both)

- **Datasets Used**:
  - Food nutritional datasets (~100,000+ items)
  - Diet recommendation dataset
  - User health and allergen data

- **Model Integration**:
  - Final predictions are generated by combining outputs from all models
  - Ensemble refinement done via Linear Regression and rule-based filtering

⚙️ How It Works
User Inputs:

Gender, Age, BMI, Allergies, Health Conditions

Model Predictions:

Diabetes status using Logistic Regression

Obesity level using XGBoost

Allergy status using Random Forest + SVM

Meal suitability using LSTM + DNN

Filtering:

Food items filtered based on:

Sugar and carbohydrate thresholds for diabetics

Caloric limits based on obesity category

Allergen exclusions (peanut, gluten)

Plan Generation:

System generates 4 meals per day for 7 days

Output saved in an Excel file for easy review
